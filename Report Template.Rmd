## Introduction
\flushleft
We are pleased to share with you a customized report of results from
the ***2014 National Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems***â€”a
survey of a national cohort of local health departments conducted
initially in 1998 and again in 2006, 2012, and 2014. The attached report
compares responses received from your department with aggregate
measures reported by other responding departments. This information
has been prepared as a courtesy to you, *and will not be disseminated
to others*. We hope you will find this information interesting and
helpful.

**Study Overview**: As you may recall, the purpose of this study is to
examine the availability of public health activities in communities
across the nation, along with the organizations that contribute to
performing these activities. The longitudinal nature of this study
provides the opportunity to examine how public health systems are
organized and how they change over time.

**Survey Instrument**: The survey instrument used in 2014, 2012, 2006, and
1998 was developed by Dr. C. Arden Miller at the University of North
Carolina and Dr. Bernard Turnock at the University of
Illinois-Chicago. This instrument was designed and validated as a
screening tool to assess the availability of 20 recommended public
health activities in the jurisdictions served by local health
departments. Each of these activities reflects one of the three core
public health functions as identified by the Institute of Medicine in
1988 (assessment, policy development, and assurance). See the appendix
to this report for more information on the instrument.

**Study Population**: The study population consists of the ~~497~~ local
health departments that reported serving jurisdictions of at least
100,000 residents in 1997. A total of 78% of these departments
responded to the survey in 1998, 68% responded in 2006, 70%
responded in 2012, and ~~81%~~ responded in 2014.

**Peer Groups**: Peer groups of local health departments were
identified through a statistical clustering procedure that grouped
departments based on similarities in several characteristics:
population size of the jurisdiction served by the department;
proportion of the population that is nonwhite; per capita personal
income in the jurisdiction; and involvement in providing environmental
health services. Each department was placed in one of 16 peer groups
for comparative analysis.

**Important Limitations**: It is important to recognize that the
instrument does not provide a comprehensive assessment of all the
important public health activities that may or may not be available at
the local level. Additionally, the instrument relies on self-reported
information provided by public health agency administrators and
therefore is subject to common sources of measurement error associated
with self-reported data. Validation studies have shown that these
sources of error have relatively little effect on the accuracy of
population estimates constructed from the instrument, but they can
have larger effects on the accuracy of individual observations such as
those provided for your individual jurisdiction in this report.

**Your Report and Feedback**: This report provides customized,
comparative results for your jurisdiction along with an appendix that
describes how measures are constructed. This report was generated
using an automated program, so errors are possible. We welcome your
comments and feedback regarding this information, ***particularly if
you note any errors or inaccuracies in the data***. Additionally, we
would be glad to send you copies of subsequent analyses and reports
from this study. Please contact our reseach team at
[publichealthPBRN@uky.edu](mailto:publichealthpbrn@uky.edu).

Thank you for your invaluable assistance in making this study
possible. Your contributions provide the critical knowledge and
information that will enable continued improvements in public health.

## Availability of Public Health Activities
\flushleft
Measures of the availability of public health activities were
constructed from responses to 20 questions asking whether or not a
specific public health activity was performed in your jurisdiction.
**Figure 1** shows the overall proportion of these activities that
were reported as available in your jurisdiction, compared to similar
"peer group" jurisdictions and to all U.S. jurisdictions included in
the survey. Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals that can be
used to assess whether your jurisdiction is significantly above/below
the peer and US benchmarks. **Table 1** provides detailed information
on the availability of each of the 20 activities.

## Perceived Effectiveness of Public Health Activities
\flushleft
Measures of the perceived effectiveness of public health activities
were constructed from responses to questions asking how well each
public health activity is performed within the jurisdiction, using a
five- point Likert scale ranging from "fully meets needs" to "meets no
needs." **Figure 2** shows the aggregate measure of perceived
effectiveness across all activities that were reported as available in
your jurisdiction, compared to similar "peer group" jurisdictions and
to all U.S. jurisdictions included in the survey. Error bars denote
95% confidence intervals that can be used to assess whether your
jurisdiction is significantly above/below the peer and US benchmarks.
**Table 2** provides detailed information on the perceived
effectivness of each of the 19 activities (activity \#20 was excluded
from this measure).

## Local Health Department Contribution to Public Health Activities
\flushleft
Measures of the local health department's contribution to public
health activities were constructed from responses to questions asking
how much of the total community effort for each public health activity
is contributed by the local department, using a five-point Likert
scale ranging from "all effort" to "no effort." **Figure 3** shows the
aggregate contribution measure across all activities that were
reported as available in your jurisdiction, compared to similar "peer
group" jurisdictions and to all U.S. jurisdictions included in the
survey. Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals that can be used to
assess whether your jurisdiction is significantly above/below the peer
and US benchmarks. **Table 3** provides detailed information on
contributions to each of the 19 activities (activity \#20 was excluded
from this measure).

## Scope of Participation by Other Organizations
\flushleft
Measures of the extent to which other organizations participate in
performing public health activities were constructed from responses to
questions asking about the types of other organizations that
contribute to each public health activity. For each type of
organization, we computed the proportion of the 19 public health activities to which
they contribute (activity \#20 was excluded from this measure).
**Figures 4-12** show these participation measures for the most
prevalent organizational categories (not all categories are shown).
Error bars denote 95% confidence intervals that can be used to assess
whether your jurisdiction is significantly above/below the peer and US
benchmarks.

## Appendix: Survey Instrument
\flushleft
The survey instrument used in this study was developed through a
series of studies on local public health practice sponsored by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For a description,
see Turnock BJ, Handler AS, Miller CA. 1998. Core function-related
local public health practice effectiveness. *Journal of Public Health
Management and Practice* 4(5):26-32. The 20 primary questions used on
the survey instrument are:

1. In your jurisdiction, is there a community needs assessment process that systematically describes the prevailing health status in the community?

2. In the past three years in your jurisdiction, has a survey of the population for behavioral risk factors been conducted?

3. In your jurisdiction, are timely investigations of adverse health events conducted on an ongoing basisâ€” including communicable disease outbreaks and environmental health hazards?

4. Are the necessary laboratory services available to the local public health agency to support investigations of adverse health events and meet routine diagnostic and surveillance needs?

5. In your jurisdiction, has an analysis been completed of the determinants of and contributing factors to priority health needs, the adequacy of existing health resources, and the population groups most effected?

6. In the past three years in your jurisdiction, has an analysis of age-specific participation in preventive and screening services been conducted?

7. In your jurisdiction, is there a network of support and communication relationships that includes health- related organizations, the media, and the general public?

8. In the past year in your jurisdiction, has there been a formal attempt to inform officials about the potential public health impact of decisions under their consideration?

9. In your jurisdiction, has there been a prioritization of community health needs that have been identified from a community needs assessment?

10. In the past three years in your jurisdiction, have community health initiatives been implemented consistent with priorities established in the community needs assessment?

11. In your jurisdiction, has a community health action plan been developed with community participation to address priority  community health needs?

12. In the past three years in your jurisdiction, were plans developed to allocate resources in a manner consistent with the community health action plan?

13. In your jurisdiction, have resources been deployed as necessary to address priority health needs identified in a community health needs assessment?

14. In the past three years in your jurisdiction, has the local public health agency conducted an organizational self-assessment?

15. In your jurisdiction, are age-specific priority health needs effectively addressed through the provision of or linkage to appropriate services?

16. In your jurisdiction, have there been regular evaluations of the effects of public health services on community health status?

17. In the past three years in your jurisdiction, has the local public health agency used professionally recognized process and outcome measures to monitor programs and to redirect resources as appropriate?

18. In your jurisdiction, is the public regularly provided with information about current health status, health care needs, positive health behaviors, and health care policy issues?

19. In the past year in your jurisdiction, have reports on public health issues been provided to the media on a regular basis?

20. In the past three years in your jurisdiction, has there been an instance in which the local public health agency has failed to implement a mandated program or service?

Each question includes a series of 3 subquestions. Download a full

## About the Public Health PBRN Program

\flushleft
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundationâ€™s ***Public Health Practice-Based
Research Networks Program*** supports research on the organization,
financing, and delivery of public health services using the
infrastructure of practice-based networks (PBRNs). A Public Health
PBRN brings multiple public health agencies into collaboration with an
academic research partner to design and conduct studies in real-world
practice settings. Currently, more than 25 public health PBRNs operate
across the U.S., involving more than 900 local and state public health
agencies, professional associations, and community partners, along
with more than 30 universities. The program supports research through
several different mechanisms, including (1) large-scale Research
Implementation Awards (RIAs) conducted by established networks; (2)
Quick-Strike Research Fund (QSRF) awards that support short-term,
time-sensitive studies on emerging issues; and (3) multi-network
studies wherein multiple PBRNs collaborate to implement studies across
large and diverse collections of public health settings.

The Public Health PBRN National Coordinating Center coordinates the
development individual and multi- network studies on a variety of
topics related to the organization, financing, and delivery of public
health services. This Center is based at the University of Kentucky
and supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. For more
